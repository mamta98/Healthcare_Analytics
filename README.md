# Healthcare_Analytics

connect to the CSV file Healthcare dataset, which includes the data regarding patients’ blood pressure, BMI, glucose, insulin, and diabetes for patients from the 20+ age group. Build 2 dashboards and then create a story using the 2 dashboards and a worksheet.

View 1: Diabetic/Non-diabetic using Shapes
Use Shapes to show the distribution between diabetic/non-diabetic patients.
Using the “Outcome” field, write a calculated field by classifying 1 as Diabetic patients and 0 as Non-diabetic patients.

View 2: Patient summary by Blood Pressure category
Use any shape of your choice to show patient summary by blood pressure category.
Show the Patient count and BP category type on the labels.

View 3: Create a Histogram to show Body Mass Index (BMI) by Age Groups.
Since we need to build a Histogram, using the Age field, let’s create bins using size 5.
Display the average BMI value on top of each bar and round it to 2 decimals.
Use the average BMI to color the palette using shades of Red.

View 4: Single Bar showing percent distribution of patients by BMI type
Create a calculated field to classify Patients by BMI types.
[BMI]<18.5= 'Underweight'
[BMI]>=18.5 and [BMI]<25 ='Healthy Weight'
[BMI]>=25 and [BMI]<30 = 'Overweight'
[BMI]>=30 ='Obese'

View 5: Bar Chart showing Patient break down by Blood Pressure and Diabetes
Create a calculated field to only highlight Diabetic patients with High and Low blood pressures.

View 6: Build a HEAT MAP showing several health factors by Age group
